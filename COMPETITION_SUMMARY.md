## Competition Strategy

The approach focused on creating a realistic simulation of the actual competition pipeline:

1. **Calibration Data Processing**: Simulated the extraction of meaningful features from instrument calibration files (dark, flat, linearity, etc.)

2. **Multi-target Prediction**: Addressed the challenge of predicting 566 values (283 wavelengths + 283 uncertainties) simultaneously

3. **Physical Constraints**: Incorporated domain knowledge about spectroscopic data (positive uncertainties, spectral continuity, realistic absorption features)

4. **Robust Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation to ensure submission quality

This framework provides a solid foundation for the actual competition when real calibration data becomes available.
